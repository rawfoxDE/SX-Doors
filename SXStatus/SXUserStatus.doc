SXUserStatus v0.4 by [r]Fox
===========================

iNTRODUCING
-----------
This is my first Online door for SX and its the first i wrote in
SASC. I use Exec Messages for SystemX only, so this door cannot
run under another bbs-software.

vERSIONS
--------

- 0.1 get all the parms and values
- 0.2 include the first gfx
- 0.3 replace something and include the
      `dISABLED` Function for File/Byteratios
- 0.4 rework the finish

iNSTALLATIOn
------------

For install it to SX do the following steps:

- copy SXUserStatus to doors:

- edit Commands/MainMenu/S as normal XIM-Command

- you may call it in an MCI-text, i.e. postlogin.ans with
  `SX_doors:SXUserStatus\120\0|`

- shutdown node and restart SX

This Door was done on a A12ooT with 030/50/50mHz and 26 MB Ram.
The Scsi-Option servs an JVC-2010 CDRecorder and some gigs are
present too. This is done in C.
