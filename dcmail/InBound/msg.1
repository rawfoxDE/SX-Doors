Hiya,

Most of the doors i write for MaxsBBS i also convert to S!X.

This is done mainly for 3 reasons..

1) So Warpig can beta test them for me.
2) For better distribution
3) Its pretty easy.

Would you like all S!X compatible door sent to you for distribution or
reference??

Lemme know m8.

Ive been learning GUI commands lately so i can make better use of the Amiga
OS than the crappy AMOS screens.. so the next SxL with have a gui in there
somewhere.. i still cant decide on the configfile formats and where to stick
them.

The only thing i can think of at the moment is to have a config file in each
'SX:Confs/' like the 'messages.dat' etc... and make this part of the package
of System-x?!

So for example a conf called..

SX:Congs/Games/ would have a directory lige :-

DIR1
DIR2
DIR3
filecheck.dat
join.ans
MsgBases.DAT
SxL.DAT

a config for each section....

What ya think???


regards K=)
