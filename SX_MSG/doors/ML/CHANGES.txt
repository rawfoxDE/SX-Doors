         --------------------------
  
   20.3.99
     
          - bugfix after Mailscan with found mail : Mainprompt does not
            show the full name of the curr. msgbase....fixed
          - bugfix in Scanroutine fixed...no empty lines in scantable
            anymore
          - implement a `+` for file attachement in Msgs list
          - optimised the source: 23k including all ansis, faster
          - update the guide
          - implement prefix `i` for base index in conference like a bull,
            so you can call it from Join.ANS without function.         

todo:
          - delete msg by nr. from subjectlist (SXFunction?) 
          - if a msg is replayed, add `re:` to the subject WHILE REPLAYING
            need implementaion in sx, too, or i do it in the ML
          - begin some tests for networking ;)
