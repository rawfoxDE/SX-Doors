 Installation:
 -------------

 If you have already the SX_MSG on your SystemX installed, 
 then you may only copy the new files over the old.
 Read the updated guide for the new features at calling SX_MSG.

 If you install the SX_MSG for the first time, you have to read
 the Guide->Install for the different form of calling the ML.

 A quickstart is not the best, but if you like, so bind a normal
 XIM-Command to the SX_MSG, restart and use.

 Thats it....NjOY!
