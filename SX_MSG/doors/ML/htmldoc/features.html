          - bugfix - cut the messagebasename to 12 chars, coz
            output trouble
          - optimised the code, i.e. done an argumentparsing
            for SX_Function
          - tuned the gfx a bit
          - added a small and raw info
   22.5.98
          - added a Mailscan what shows unreaded and new mails
            Mailscan let you choose between read the new msg,
            do not read or quit mailscan. If you like to read
            your new mail, Mailscan joins the msg automatic,
            acceps `eall`,`all` and `username` to be active
          - call the door with argument `s` for mailscan only !
          - added an argument for `s` (scan for unreaded msgs,
            named `o` to switch all msgs in all msgbases to
            OLD.<P>

          - added an argument for `L` (Listview) were you can
            give a msgnumb from what you like to view the list
   28.5.98
          - Mail/Msgscan has now a conference user access level
            check. If the User has no access to any conference,<P>

            the mailscan breaks.
          - an Informationpage was added with more detailed
            explaination about the commands        
   30.5.98
          - if Users Screenlength &lt;= 27 lines, the
            informationpage switched to a second part
          - optimised the source, killed lamershit. source: 54k
            including all Ansis
    1.6.98
          - make the conference axx check more advanced. checks
            now all confs for axx, does not break after noaxx
            anymore. 
            Ex: Confaxx:  XXX_XX_X
          - do some more small internal fixes, opts, gfx,
            funcs,... only penouts
    3.6.98
          - bugfix - after Mailscan found new mail, the
            CommandPrompt is ok now. fixed some penouts, too
          - finish this Guide
   20.3.99
          - make very more code optimisations. source: 20k
          - add prefix `i` to show the MsgBases of the actual
            conference, only
          - fix a bug in SX: Join.ANS was shown before you 
            really join the conference, so if you call Doors
            from theJoin.ANS file, what are MsgBase specific,
            you earn the data from last conf.
            Now use ML as internal map command to call it in
            Join.ANS like:
            ~SX_MI\17\0| (execute internal map function)
          - add a blue(Esc[34m)`+` as flag for fileattaches in 
            the Msg.<P>

   known Bugs:
                        
   - MailScan does not work 100%, sometimes new Msgs are
     not found and any crap is typed and the LRP is set :(
     I will fix this, when i include SX-Config-&gt;Doors-&gt;MailScan
     in SystemX soon.<P>
