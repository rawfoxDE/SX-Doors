 -------------<P>

<B> ! ALL NEW FEATURES OF THIS UPDATE RUN ONLY CORRECT ON !
 !    SYSTEMX v1.o6b [eSSeXX] BY DIGITAL CORRUPTION    !</B><P>

 The MessageLister gives you a powerfull handling 
 for the MessageBases of SystemX. 
 The Door is so advanced in its handling, that i use the
 other Message Commands  like `E` or `R` to it, too.
 You may give any Commandname you like. `ML` as Commandname 
 runs fine here, including the fingerdynamics ;)<P>

 Now do it :<P>

 - Copy all archive contents to SX:Doors/ML/ or any Directory
   you like.<P>

 - configure the Door call<P>

   + as <A href=inst_MS.html>MailScan</A>   
   + as <A href=inst_BB.html>BaseBull</A>
 
 - Restart SystemX, so the new settings will be activated<P>

 Thats all.
 Now Login and call the Door in your selected way.
 While startup the Door shows you an Index about the installed
 MessageBases in the current Conference and a CommandPrompt,
 were you may enter yer actions.
 Check one of the scan-functions to see,
 if all Conferences/MessageBases
 are scanned for you. if not, so check your Conference Access.<P>
