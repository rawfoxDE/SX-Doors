 (<I>if the sysop </I><A href=inst_MCI.html>calls the Door by MCI-File</A>) 
 or the Door starts direcly with an overview of the installed 
 MsgBases in the actual conference, you are.<P>

                  |           |                    |        
                  |           |                    |
